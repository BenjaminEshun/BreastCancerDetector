# Project Description: Breast Cancer Detection using Image Classification

This project focuses on the detection of breast cancer through an image classification task. Leveraging the "BreakHis 400X" dataset sourced from Kaggle, the project's objective is to accurately differentiate between benign and malignant breast tumours based on microscopic biopsy images.

The dataset comprises microscopic images of both benign and malignant breast tumours. To achieve the classification task, a deep learning architecture is employed, with the renowned "VGG 16" serving as the foundational model. This well-established convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is known for its ability to extract intricate features from images.

In addition to the VGG 16 base model, a custom dense layer is incorporated into the architecture. This layer is designed to further refine the model's ability to discriminate between benign and malignant tumours. Through a comprehensive training process, the model learns to recognize key patterns and characteristics within the biopsy images that are indicative of tumor malignancy.

Ultimately, the project's aim is to create a reliable and accurate tool for assisting medical professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. By harnessing the power of deep learning and image classification techniques, this endeavour contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance healthcare diagnostics and outcomes.
